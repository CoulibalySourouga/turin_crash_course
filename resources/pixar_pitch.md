## Example

**Title: Libraries as Community data hubs**

Once upon a time the funding libraries received had been slashed to a point where many libraries had closed and many more were in danger of doing so.
That was due, in part, to difficulties in valorising the value they brought to the communities they serve and a lack of innovation in how they addressed emerging needs within those same communities.

Every day they would interact with members of the communities they serve, providing guidance, comfort or simply a	warm place to go, but struggle to leverage their skills to generate more visible impact on their community, despite knowing that it was crucial to secure continued funding from local councils.

One Day Open Knowledge Foundation came up with a strategy to build the capacity of libraries to work with citizens on collecting and using data to address local issues, leveraging the librariesâ€™ skills (such as curation) and assets (such as library computers) and motivating citizens and their local councils to take action on those issues using a shared evidence base.

Because of that libraries were able to generate more social value out of their skills, assets and central place within the community; communities had quicker access to evidence relevant to the issues they care about, making it easier for them to reach consensus, take action and advocate for their rights; journalists and public officials gained a better knowledge of the reality of their communities, improving their own ability to do their work; and librarians valorised their skills and relevance allowing them to secure funding for the library.

Until finally libraries around the country, sharing best practices, made use of this approach to secure a sustainable future for themselves, thanks to the recognition from local governments and philanthropic funders that the value they created went far beyond access to culture.
