**Title**: TeleHealth

**Description**: Development of a Digital Health platform called "TeleHealth," to allow healthcare professionals to remotely diagnose and treat patients so to bridge substantial gaps in health infrastructure accessibility within remote and underserved regions, and address challenges caused by geographical isolation, lack of information, and inadequate health facility distribution.  We would involve local communities in multiple remote areas to understand the context (including technological infrastructures and barriers), understand the main needs and habits of the local communities, gain local trust and implement the best possible solution.
Our approach would integrate data analytics throughout the project, from the design (to analyse the context and the challenges, figure the available healthcare resources), to the implementation, to the actual monitoring of health data by the health practitioners involved in the TeleHealth solution.
