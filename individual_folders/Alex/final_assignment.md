# Request for Proposals (RFP): Mitigating Urban Heat Islands for Vulnerable Populations in Developing Countries  


**DEFINITION: Heat Islands for vulnerable populations**

Urban Heat Islands" (UHIs) refers to urban areas where the temperature is significantly higher than in surrounding areas, due to the concentration of buildings, roads, pavements, and other structures that absorb and retain heat. These areas tend to experience higher temperatures than nearby rural areas, especially during the summer months.

When we talk about "Urban Heat Islands for Vulnerable Populations," we refer to groups of people such as the homeless, migrants, elderly individuals, young children, and people with pre-existing medical conditions. These groups often have less access to resources to protect themselves from extreme heat, such as air conditioning, adequate shelter, or access to clean water.

This situation could lead in health problems as heat strokers or dehydaration. 

# Project description
Project aims to support national health system in order to develop plans and implement actions for emergency situations (Earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, fire...), and be able to execute quick solutions and provide health support in rural areas to it's population. 
# Define
## Research question
How to optimize the distribution and access to health infrastructure in rural areas during climate emergencies to guarantee an effective response?
## Hypotheses
The mapping and the creation of disaster plans can guide and strength the health system national, so the access to the health infrastructures can be provided or readapted to fulfill the needs.
## Hypothesis notes
Find data from the national health system with locations of all heath infrastructures & population to map it.
