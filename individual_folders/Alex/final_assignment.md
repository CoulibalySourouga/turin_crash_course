**Heat Islands for vulnerable populations
Urban Heat Islands" (UHIs) refers to urban areas where the temperature is significantly higher than in surrounding areas, due to the concentration of buildings, roads, pavements, and other structures that absorb and retain heat. These areas tend to experience higher temperatures than nearby rural areas, especially during the summer months.
When we talk about "Urban Heat Islands for Vulnerable Populations," we refer to groups of people such as the homeless, migrants, elderly individuals, young children, and people with pre-existing medical conditions. These groups often have less access to resources to protect themselves from extreme heat, such as air conditioning, adequate shelter, or access to clean water.
This situation could lead in health problems as heat strokers or dehydaration.
