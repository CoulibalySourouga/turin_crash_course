    "According to MIT Climate Portal, the urban heat island effect is a phenomenon whereby cities experience higher air temperatures than the surrounding countryside. Scientists refer to areas afflicted by these higher temperatures as urban heat islands, and people living in these areas are particularly exposed to the effects of climate change. (https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/urban-heat-islands).\n",

    "Moreover, certain social groups are particularly vulnerable to crises, including climate change, for example, **children**, persons with disabilities, ethnic minorities, **migrant workers**, **displaced persons**, **older people**, and other socially marginalized groups.

    "If we focus our attention on migrants (and in particular refugees) and displaced people, the UNHCR (UN Refugee Agency) states that the vast majority of refugees (approximately 78 percent) do not live in camps but in cities, and are therefore more vulnerable to the extreme heatwaves caused by climate change. In general urban locations offer more opportunities to live autonomously and find employment, but they also pose major challenges as refugees are often forced to share accommodation or live in non-functional public buildings, collective centers, slums or other types of informal settlements with substandard living conditions.
