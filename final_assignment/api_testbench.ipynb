    "This notebook aims to compile beginner-friendly documentation of APis relevant to the work of civic actors active in the field of international development. The project was started in 2024 by [Cedric Lombion](https://civicliteraci.es) to support his teaching at the University of Turin's ICT for Development and Social Good master's programme. Nonetheless, the project bears no formal affiliation with the university. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each entry aims to document key information and examples about the API being documented, with a focus on making them more accessible to beginners to APIs and command line scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fork the repository\n",
    "2. add your API descriptioni and examples\n",
    "3. Ensure that your examples are well documented an suitable for beginners\n",
    "4. send a pull request which will be reviewed for addition. \n",
    "\n",
    "For suggestion or improvements, open an issue on the repository. Alternatively, contact us at contact [at] civicliteraci.es"

There two components to the\\n            projects. The first component of the project is purchase of\\n            carbon emissions reductions. Certified emissions reduction\\n            (CFE) uses a long-term power planning simulation model\\n            (DECADES) to select future power plants that are needed for\\n            the expansion of the country's electricity system. On\\n            the basis of such modeling results it is possible to compare\\n            alternative scenarios of new generation plants and estimate\\n            emissions with- and without the wind power plants in the\\n            long term. During the operational period the actual\\n            dispatching of energy generated from the wind power plant is\\n            controlled by the National Center for Energy Control\\n            (CENACE) and can be monitored in real time to record the\\n            amount of electricity produced from the plant and the\\n            equivalent avoided emissions for verification purposes.

The growth of wind power has\\n            also occurred due to its other positive attributes,\\n            including growing economic competitiveness.

While recognizing the\\n            problems with published data, we show that in the\\n            competitive policy regimes of the UK, USA and Australia, the\\n            data are consistent with a classical economic theory:\\n            learning curve, scale economies of project size, turbine\\n            size, and turbine order explain 81 percent of the variation\\n            of reported project costs. By contrast, the German project\\n            cost data, and the set of data from the rest of the world,\\n            reveal no statistically significant relationship between\\n            these factors and reported project costs. However, published\\n            German turbine list prices do reveal learning curve, turbine\\n            size, and turbine order size economies, though the\\n            explanatory power of the model is lower (R2=0.61). The\\n            results demonstrate that only in competitive policy regimes\\n            are the benefits of learning curve and scale economies\\n            passed to the consumer; while in Feed-in Law regimes\\n            (Germany, Spain) the principal beneficiary is the developer.\"},\"display_title\":\"Statistical analysis of wind farm\\n            costs and policy regimes\",\"listing_relative_url\":\"/research/2000/01/5704111/statistical-analysis-wind-farm-costs-policy-regimes\",\"url_friendly_title\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/460141468748770824/Statistical-analysis-of-wind-farm-costs-and-policy-regimes\",\"new_url\":\"2000/01/5704111/statistical-analysis-wind-farm-costs-policy-regimes\",\"guid\":\"460141468748770824\",\"url\":\"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/460141468748770824/Statistical-analysis-of-wind-farm-costs-and-policy-regimes\"},\"D698043\":{\"id\":\"698043\",\"count\":\"Costa Rica\",\"entityids\":{\"entityid\":\"000009265_3961219144813\"},\"docdt\":\"1994-09-30T00:00:00Z\",\"abstracts\":{\"cdata!\":\"The overall objectives of the Tejona\\n            Wind Power Project is to improve the environment by reducing\\n            the consumption of fossil fuels for energy production.
